   <p>Mercedes has always been known for their combination of luxury and performance, but we will only be talking about the E class specifcally. Production years for the E 55 was from 2003-2006. In 2003, Mercedes released the E 55 AMG with a 5.4 litre SOHC(single overhead cam)engine, complemented with a 5 speed automatic transmission which was used in v12 AMG models. This engine was handbuilt and named the M113K and is one of the most legendary AMG engines Mercedes would ever produce. It put out a whopping 469 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. 0-60 mph in just 4.1 seconds and did the 1/4 mile in 12.2 seconds. It later on would win the title of the fastest super-sedan in the world,faster than its competitors, BMW and Audi. After a few years in 2005, the E 55 recieved multiple revisions including a better differential and a tacometer that clocked to 200 mph. in addtion to its beast of an engine, its very tunable and with simple bolt-ons, it can make north of 600 horsepower with just a few thousand dollars. The top speed of the E 55 was 205 miles an hour which is insanely fast for a 4,200 lb car. Down below is a chart of the basic specs and prices of the car.  </p>
