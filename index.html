  <h2> The w211 E 55 AMG</h2>
   <p style="font-size:20px">Mercedes has always been known for their combination of luxury and performance, but we will only be talking about the E class specifcally. Production years for the E 55 was from 2003-2006. In 2003, Mercedes released the E 55 AMG with a 5.4 litre SOHC(single overhead cam)engine, complemented with a 5 speed automatic transmission which was used in v12 AMG models. This engine was handbuilt and named the M113K and is one of the most legendary AMG engines Mercedes would ever produce. It put out a whopping 469 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. 0-60 mph in just 4.1 seconds and did the 1/4 mile in 12.2 seconds. It later on would win the title of the fastest super-sedan in the world,faster than its competitors, BMW and Audi. After a few years in 2005, the E 55 recieved multiple revisions including a better differential and a tacometer that clocked to 200 mph. in addtion to its beast of an engine, its very tunable and with simple bolt-ons, it can make north of 600 horsepower with just a few thousand dollars. The top speed of the E 55 was 205 miles an hour which is insanely fast for a 4,200 lb car. Down below is a chart of the basic specs and prices of the car.  </p>

    <h2>The w211 E63 AMG</H2>
        <p>After the production of the E 55 AMG ended in 2006, Mercedes introduced a new AMG model called the E63. Production for this car was from 2007-2009. This was AMG's first engine that they fully developed themselves. A 6.2 litre DOHC(dual
        overhead cam) v8 engine nicknamed the M156. The M156 was complemented with a new 7 speed automatic transmission that
        shifted faster than the snap of your fingers. Not using a supercharger or turbo, this car made 507 horsepower and 450
        lb-ft of torque with a naturally aspirated engine. Although the E 63 has more horsepower than the E 55, it was slower
        than the E 55 in the ¼ mile and from 0-60. The E 63 did 0-60 in 4.5 seconds and the ¼ mile in 12.6 seconds. This engine
        would later on also have fatal engine issues. The head bolts of this car were made from a weak material causing them to
        erode over time and snap which would lead to head gasket failure which could blow the engine. It also had premature
        camshaft wear and camshaft adjuster problems. All of these gave the M156 engine a bad reputation and did not sell nearly
        as well as the E 55 AMG did. These engines were also not very tunable unless you added a form of forced induction like a
        turbo or supercharger which was not cheap. A supercharger for the M156 was around $12,000, not to mention the hassle of
        installing it with all the conversions needed for it to fit. It's safe to say that if you did not take care of your E
        63, it will cut deep into your pockets to fix. Down below is a chart of the basic specs and prices of the car Down below
