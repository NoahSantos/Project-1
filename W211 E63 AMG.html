        <h1>History of the W211 E63 AMG</h1>
    </center>
    <p style="font-size:20px">After the production of the E 55 AMG ended in 2006, Mercedes introduced a new AMG model
        called the E63. Production for this car was from 2007-2009. This was AMG's first engine that they fully
        developed themselves. A 6.2 litre DOHC(dual overhead cam) v8 engine nicknamed the M156. The M156 was
        complemented with a new 7 speed automatic transmission that shifted faster than the snap of your fingers. Not
        using a supercharger or turbo, this car made 507 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque with a naturally aspirated
        engine. Although the E 63 has more horsepower than the E 55, it was slower than the E 55 in the ¼ mile and from
        0-60. The E 63 did 0-60 in 4.5 seconds and the ¼ mile in 12.6 seconds. This engine would later on also have
        fatal engine issues. The head bolts of this car were made from a weak material causing them to erode over time
        and snap which would lead to head gasket failure which could blow the engine. It also had premature camshaft
        wear and camshaft adjuster problems. All of these gave the M156 engine a bad reputation and did not sell nearly
        as well as the E 55 AMG did. These engines were also not very tunable unless you added a form of forced
        induction like a turbo or supercharger which was not cheap. A supercharger for the M156 was around $12,000, not
        to mention the hassle of installing it with all the conversions needed for it to fit. It's safe to say that if
        you did not take care of your E 63, it will cut deep into your pockets to fix. Down below is a chart of the
        basic specs and prices of the car. </p>
